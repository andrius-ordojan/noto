Your task is to extract the most important concepts, steps, and code examples from the note and linked content below. Do NOT write an article. Instead:

- Use a bullet-point list format with clear sections and short explanations.
- Include key concepts, implementation steps, and relevant code samples.
- Keep it technical and concise. Avoid storytelling or introductions.
- Use Markdown formatting: headings (##), bullet points, and fenced code blocks.
- Target length: around 500-800 words. Prioritize clarity and density.
- At the end, include a section titled “Reference” with the original URLs.
