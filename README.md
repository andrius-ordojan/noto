# sir-briefalot

Sir Briefalot is a tool for building and maintaining a personal knowledge baseâ€”without the overhead of writing full notes by hand.

It scans markdown files from my Obsidian vault, detects saved links, and pulls in the content behind them. It combines that source material with any notes or directions Iâ€™ve added, and feeds everything into an LLM to generate a concise, structured summary for future reference.

Whether it's technical documentation, cooking tips, philosophy articles, or blog postsâ€”Sir Briefalot distills the key takeaways into clean, readable notes.

To protect against link rot, all referenced web pages are archived using (ArchiveBox)[https://archivebox.io/], ensuring the original context is always preservedâ€”even if the source disappears.

This way, I can continue saving links and jotting quick thoughts, while still ending up with a durable, searchable, and well-organized archive of what Iâ€™ve learned.

ðŸ›  Note: Sir Briefalot is still under active development and not yet ready for general use.
